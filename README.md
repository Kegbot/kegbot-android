Kegbot for Android
===================

Overview
--------

This is the source code for the Kegbot Android application!

Main repository: https://github.com/Kegbot/kegbot-android

Home page: http://kegbot.org/


Developers: Quick Setup Instructions
------------------------------------

Bear with us as better develop documentation is coming!

In the meantime, here are quick and dirty steps:

- Get a copy of usb-serial-for-android: http://code.google.com/p/usb-serial-for-android/
- Eclipse: Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace.
- Import the projects (UsbSerialLibrary, UsbSerialExamples)
- Clone the kegbot-android repo and do the same steps, importing Kegtap and KegtapTest
- Project properties should be set correctly automatically.  In particular:
  UsbSerialLibrary should be marked as an Android library project (on which
  Kegtap depends).
